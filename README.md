- 👋 Hi, I’m tommy tom!
- 👀 I’m interested in making sure our teams have confidence that they are building the right things the right way.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Selenium, Java, JavaScript, CSharp, and regularly revisiting all the things I say I already know.
- 🔧 I like to solve personal tedia in BASH, and for bigger things I like Python or JavaScript.
- 💞️ I’m striving for a Middle Path that will enrich lives.
- 💜 We can all do better (except for JK Rowling apparently)!  And when I say "We", I mean myself first.  <3
- ✅ Because nobody asked, how about This or That:
  - **Paper or Plastic**:  [studies](https://mst.dk/erhverv/groen-produktion-og-affald/affald-og-genanvendelse/cirkulaer-oekonomi-og-ressourceeffektivitet) [have](https://www.niassembly.gov.uk/globalassets/documents/raise/publications/2011/environment/3611.pdf) [shown](https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/topics/in-depth/waste-and-recycling/municipal-and-packaging-waste-management-country-profiles-2025/dk-municipal-waste-factsheet.pdf/@@download/file) that Single-Use Plastics are far more energy-, air-, and water-efficient than Paper and other grocery sacks.  But that's kind of the whole thing, isn't it?  "Single-Use".  Use _Bamboo_ chopsticks for starters!
  - **Coke or Pepsi**:  [_hear-say_]:  Coca-cola was invented before A/C, whereas Pepsi arrived later; ergo, Pepsi's recipe was made to taste better chilled.  i like [crystal light energy on the go grape](https://www.americangrocer.co.uk/products/crystal-light-on-the-go-grape-drink-mix-33-8g?pr_prod_strat=e5_desc&pr_rec_id=11e63c82d&pr_rec_pid=8197856952572&pr_ref_pid=5277078454430&pr_seq=uniform) [DAMN, MORE SINGLE-USE PLASTICS!]
  - **Day or Night**:  i installed a [firefox extension](https://darkreader.org/) specifically to force every web site to display dark, through violence or coercion.
  - **IE or Chrome**:  if it weren't for the revolving door of anti-trust lawsuits, it's feared the Mozilla foundation would dry up without Google Search payments.  You Remember Google, right?  "[_You can trust us!_](https://therecord.media/google-settles-for-lying-geolocation)"  "_Our motto is_ [_~~Don't Be Evil!~~_](https://www.mozillafoundation.org/en/campaigns/googles-data-safety-labels/)  '[_We've never even_ heard _of NSA, or PRISM!_](https://theweek.com/articles/463443/here-are-tech-companies-denying-involvement-nsas-prism-program)"  Firefox makes a great browser for testing too.  It does JS just a little different so i see bugs others might not.
  - **Left or Right**:  it really doesn't matter where you part your hair, cuz [someone else will come along and move it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_QFMuieWiI)
  - **Ad-based or Premium**:  i don't know, [what do you think](https://github.com/YouTube-Enhancer/extension)?
  - **Coffee or Tea**:  a 2023 study published in the [_Annals of Internal Medicine_](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/drinking-coffee-might-lengthen-life) declared that people who enjoy a few cups of coffee each morning tend to live longer.  So sign me the f$%# up for [Nathan's](https://nathansfranks.sfdbrands.com/en-us/promotions/hot-dog-eating-contest/) [Hot Dog Challenge](https://scitechdaily.com/hot-dogs-soda-and-a-540000-person-warning-ultra-processed-foods-shorten-life/), and i'll enjoy a Monster in the white can, [whatever that flavor is called](https://i.imgur.com/TqbwiwH.jpeg).
  - **the Movie or the Book**:  [First things first:  Orson Scott Card and JK Rowling can take a long walk off a short dock.]  Why do people conflate the movie and the book?  They are different media, hence they are necessarily different works!  "They changed the ending!  The bad guy loses!"  "They changed my favorite character's hair color!"  They didn't _change_ a thing.  They wrote and played a FanFic in the same EU as your favorite bad guy's hair color, and you're having a panic attack over it.  Go back to your local bookshop and stop talking during the movie.
  - **Milk or Dark**:  White.  I _KNOW_ it has no cocoa, so it really isn't chocolate at all.  I don't care.
  - **Ice or No Ice**:  it's hot, and it'll only be getting hotter.
  - **Chicken or Fish**:  a cheese package we recently ate said "Humanely Raised Cows".  i was incensed.  We don't need to anthropomorphize everyone!  "Bovanely" or get out of my house!
  - **Cats or Dogs**:  cats.  [i just think they're neat.](https://imgur.com/60W0uN0)
