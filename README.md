- 👋 Hi, I’m tommy tom!
- 👀 I’m interested in making sure our teams have confidence they are building the right things the right way.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Kubernetes, Python, Golang, and all things I say I already know.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything I can do to make lives easier and better.
