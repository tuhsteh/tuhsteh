- 👋 Hi, I’m tommy tom!
- 👀 I’m interested in making sure our teams have confidence that they are building the right things the right way.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Selenium, Java, JavaScript, CSharp, and regularly revisiting all the things I say I already know.
- 🔧 I like to solve personal tedia in BASH, and for bigger things I like Python or JavaScript.
- 💞️ I’m striving for a Middle Path that will enrich lives.
- 💜 We can all do better (except for JK Rowling apparently)!  And when I say "We", I mean myself first.  <3
- ✅ Because nobody asked, how about This or That:
  - #### **Paper or Plastic**
      [studies](https://mst.dk/erhverv/groen-produktion-og-affald/affald-og-genanvendelse/cirkulaer-oekonomi-og-ressourceeffektivitet "Cirkulær økonomi og ressourceeffektivitet") [have](https://www.niassembly.gov.uk/globalassets/documents/raise/publications/2011/environment/3611.pdf "the Misspelling of Irish names has long been my Pet Piamh") [shown](https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/topics/in-depth/waste-and-recycling/municipal-and-packaging-waste-management-country-profiles-2025/dk-municipal-waste-factsheet.pdf/@@download/file "holy crap, a whole front-end for a DB full of demographics, waste stats, transportation, like everything!") that Single-Use Plastics are far more energy-, air-, and water-efficient than Paper and other grocery sacks.  But that's kind of the whole thing, isn't it?  "Single-Use".  Use _Bamboo_ chopsticks for starters!
  - #### **Coke or Pepsi**
      [_hear-say_]:  Coca-cola was invented before A/C, whereas Pepsi arrived later; ergo, Pepsi's recipe was made to taste better chilled.  i like [crystal light energy on the go grape](https://www.americangrocer.co.uk/products/crystal-light-on-the-go-grape-drink-mix-33-8g, "Come here kids! I'm gonna GRAPE you in the mouth!  (RIP In Peace, Trevor)") [DAMN, MORE SINGLE-USE PLASTICS!]
  - #### **Day or Night**
      i installed a [firefox extension](https://darkreader.org/, "Свет? В этой экономике?") specifically to force, through violence or coersion, every web site to display dark.
  - #### **IE or Chrome**
       it's feared the Mozilla foundation would dry up, were it not for the revolving door of anti-trust lawsuits and Google Search payments.  You Remember Google, right?  "[_You can trust us!_](https://therecord.media/google-settles-for-lying-geolocation "Incognito? More like Incogwriteeverythingdownito!")"  "_Our motto is_ [_~~Don't Be Evil!~~_](https://www.mozillafoundation.org/en/campaigns/googles-data-safety-labels/ "When someone tells you who they are, believe them the first time.  --Maya Angelou")"  "[_We've never even_ heard _of NSA, or PRISM!_](https://theweek.com/articles/463443/here-are-tech-companies-denying-involvement-nsas-prism-program "Would you mind awfully speaking up, and directly into my lapel?")"  Firefox makes a great browser for testing too.  It does JS just a little different so i see bugs others might not.
  - #### **Left or Right**
      it really doesn't matter where you part your hair, cuz [someone else will come along and move it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_QFMuieWiI "i know i'm certainly the Mayor of Simpleton")
  - #### **Ad-based or Premium**
      i don't know, [what do you think](https://github.com/YouTube-Enhancer/extension "FIVE-MINUTE UNSKIPPABLE ADS HATE THIS ONE TRICK!")?
  - #### **Coffee or Tea**
      a 2023 study published in the [_Annals of Internal Medicine_](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/drinking-coffee-might-lengthen-life "Burnt.  Angry.  Bean Water.") declared that people who enjoy a few cups of coffee each morning tend to live longer.  So sign me the f$%# up for [Nathan's](https://nathansfranks.sfdbrands.com/en-us/promotions/hot-dog-eating-contest/ "your word of the day is 'Abattoir'") [Hot Dog Challenge](https://scitechdaily.com/hot-dogs-soda-and-a-540000-person-warning-ultra-processed-foods-shorten-life/ "30 Seconds To Tachycardia"), and i'll enjoy a Monster in the white can, [whatever that flavor is called](https://i.imgur.com/TqbwiwH.jpeg "All bad apples, you say?").
  - #### **the Movie or the Book**
      [First things first:  Orson Scott Card and JK Rowling can take a long walk off a short dock.]  Why do people conflate the movie and the book?  They are different media, hence they are necessarily different works!  "They changed the ending!  The bad guy loses!"  "They changed my favorite character's hair color!"  They didn't _change_ a thing.  They wrote and played a slash-fiction in the same EU as your favorite bad guy's hair color, and you're having a panic attack over it.  Go back to your local bookshop and stop talking during the movie.
  - #### **Milk or Dark**
      White.  I _KNOW_ it has no cocoa, so it really isn't chocolate at all.  I don't care.  
      I also really like Hershey's HUGS.  And yes, i know that Hershey's chocolate has a little bit of butyric acid, which people clamor makes it taste slightly of vomit.  I still don't care.
  - #### **Ice or No Ice**
      it's hot, and it'll only be getting hotter.  I'm committed though.  Something i can personally do to help the environment is promise not to kill 11 people and dump 4 million barrels of oil in the Gulf of Mexico.
  - #### **Chicken or Fish**
      a cheese package we recently ate said "Humanely Raised Cows".  i was incensed.  We don't need to anthropomorphize everyone!  "Bovanely" or get out of my house!
  - #### **Cats or Dogs**
      cats.  [i just think they're neat!](https://imgur.com/60W0uN0)
