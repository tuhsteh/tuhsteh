- 👋 Hi, I’m tommy tom!
- 👀 I’m interested in making sure our teams have confidence they are building the right things the right way.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Selenium, Java, CSharp, and regularly revisiting all the things I say I already know.
- 💞️ I’m striving for a Middle Path that will enrich lives.
- We can all do better!  And when I say "We", I mean myself first.  <3
